    <p >Personal information: I am a Australian man living south of Perth in Busselton, Western Australia.
I work full time as a wood machinist and I am studying computer science at RMIT. In my free time I like to play drums in a local band, play games of  Warhammer : Age of Sigmar and run a scout group. <p>

  <h1> Interest in IT<h1>
    <p> I have always had an interest in IT, I spent most of my teenage years gaming on my PC and developed an interest from there. In high school I studied computer science as an elective and did quite well. I stopped studying IT as work and other interests took precedence but I have always maintained an interest in computers and technology. I have experience in building PC's as well as a basic understanding of coding and the underlying principles of computing.<p>
    <p>I chose to study with RMIT due to the flexibility of courses and the way online study is conducted. I have studied online at different universities and RMIT is the most accessible and straightforward universities I have studied with. As I am now looking to complete a full degree RMIT seems to be the perfect choice. <p>
    <p>While studying at RMIT I expect to learn how to program and work with other people on IT projects. I hope that the combination of Technical and social skills I will learn will set me up to have a successful career in this field. I have an interest in web design and would like to move into that field once my studies are complete so I would expect this degree to lay the groundwork for me to study further and learn more about this field. <p>
